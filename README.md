# Neo4j-based Graph Database of WordNet Type
In this project for the ["Databases 2"](https://www.hse.ru/ba/ling/courses/339492987.html) course we, as a team of students:
- parced the information about frequency of hyponimic relations between a set of words
- parced the connections between the meanings of the same set of words
- invented the architecture for our database ![photo_2021-03-30_18-46-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9317484/113017883-9a957d00-9188-11eb-9a53-f30a53e19924.jpg)
- optimised parced data for the DB creation with Neo4j methods and instruments 
- programmed a custom web-interface for interaction with the DB

The performance of the DB was tested on:
- CRUD actions
- Sorting, grouping and clusterisation
- Path finding for distant nodes
